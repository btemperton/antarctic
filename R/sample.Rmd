### This will serve as a testbed for R Markdown

Text will be used above code blocks to tell you what the code is going to do. For instance, this one will calculate the mean of a list

```{r}
x <-runif(100)
x
```
The mean of these numbers can then be displayed inline like this. The mean of the result is `r mean(x)`.

Also, we can make plots like this:
```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
hist(x)
```

By using R Markdown, we can keep a track of all of the analyses we do, which will make publication easier and will avoid a long email trail. Any questions can be raised as issues on the scripts. It'll be a nice learning tool for anyone else to then come along and use it.
